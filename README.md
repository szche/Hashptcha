## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works
After clicking the *"I am not a robot"* button, client receives a following cryptographic puzzle to solve:

```json
{
	'hash_type': 'MD5',
	'start_point': '100110000111001000000101',
	'target': '10001000010111101100',
	'token': '44b0f554-1348-42be-a3f5-c24885611530'
}
```
where:

 - **hash_type** - defines what hash function needs to be used (currently service supports only MD5 and SHA256)
 - **start_point** - binary representation of a starting value used for cracking. Correct solution needs to find value higher than start_point
 - **target** - hashcash-style target. Defines prefix of binary representation of calculated hash. Used to regulate difficulty and ensure user is not coming up with random hashes
 - **token** - random value associated with the task. Used to ensure that noone tries to replay the same task more than once

Once user finds the solution, he then sends the solution to the application back-end alongside his form data. Server sends following request to the Hashptcha service provider to ensure the puzzle has been solved correctly:
```json
{
	'token': '44b0f554-1348-42be-a3f5-c24885611530',
	'value': '101010001000110011110101',
	'secret_key': '0c7906a0-8c45-4cb1-b8b2-cf8cd259d7fd'
}
```
where:

 - **token** - random value associated with the task. Same as before
 - **value** - binary representation of a value, which hash achieves the target. Additionaly value must be higher than start_point
 - **secret_key** - random value used to identify website using the service. You can think of it as an API key.

Simplified service flow can be seen on the picture below.

## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

 - Add more hash functions
 - **Calculations on homomorphic encryption instead of hash cracking?**
